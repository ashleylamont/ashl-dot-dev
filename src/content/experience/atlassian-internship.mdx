# Atlassian SWE Internship

In the 2023-2024 summer holidays, I've had the opportunity to take a break from my work at [Services Australia](/experience/services-australia) and join the team at [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) as a Software Engineering Intern.

## What I did

I joined the [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) team, specifically the J-Love <abbr title="Unrelated to any food delivery apps by the same name">Deliveroo</abbr> team.
