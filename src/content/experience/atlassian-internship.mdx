In the 2023-2024 summer holidays, I've had the opportunity to take a break from my work at [Services Australia](/experience/services-australia) and join the team at [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) as a Software Engineering Intern.

## What I did

I joined the [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) team, specifically the J-Love <abbr title="Unrelated to any food delivery apps by the same name">Deliveroo</abbr> team.
Deliveroo is a cross-functional tiger-team with the goal of improving the Jira experience for all users.
At the time of writing, the team was focusing on the ease of use of the Jira platform.

Particularly, I was involved in the "Updating Issues" stream, which involved a number of initiatives to improve the experience of updating issues in Jira, such as the [Jira Command Palette](https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-Software-articles/Introducing-Command-Palette-for-Jira/ba-p/2338582), which was my focus.

During my internship, I was able to accomplish many things:

- Rebuilt the <abbr title="Jira Command Palette">ComPal</abbr> frontend search experience to use an implementation of the bitap algorithm, allowing for significantly improved search experiences and result relevancy.
- Fixed several longstanding bugs and issues through detailed root cause analysis and investigation.
- Identified conflicts between the Jira platform and cross-platform Atlassian technologies, and rallied support from relevant teams to begin the process of finding a solution.
- Solved the problem of "Poor Organisation that Obstructs Progress" (POOP) during [ShipIt](https://www.atlassian.com/company/shipit) by creating a Confluence App that could visually chart out spaces by semantic content in pages, along with a team of interns from across the company.
- Got involved in the fight against [Canva](https://www.canva.com/about/) during the Atlassian X Canva "One Impact Cycle" [SSBU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Ultimate) battle.
- Created a new suite of experimental commands during the Deliveroo Innovation ~Week~ Fortnight Sprint that allowed users to quickly apply filters in Jira.
- Organised several togetherness events, both between members of the intern cohort and the Deliveroo team, to get to know my colleagues, and contribute to building a positive company culture.

## What I learned

- How to work in an engineering team at scale, and how to effectively communicate with other teams.
- How to work with a large codebase, and how to effectively navigate it.
- How to work with a large existing product, and develop new features and changes safely with multiple types of tests, feature flags, and other safety measures.
