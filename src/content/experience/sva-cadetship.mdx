I have worked at Services Australia since the start of 2022, and since late 2022 on the SharePoint Application Support team.

## What I did

In my role as a SharePoint Developer and Analyst, I was responsible for assisting the <abbr title="SharePoint Application Support">SAS</abbr> team in the development and maintenance of software solutions for the agency.

Notably, due to my technical background and experience in front-end technologies, I worked alongside the team's senior developer as a developer first and foremost, building applications to support agency objectives, and providing in-team technical support where required, as well as getting involved on support tickets involving complex issues related to front-end technologies and JavaScript/TypeScript applications.

## What I learned

- How to lead small projects and co-ordinate stakeholders and resources
- How to take ownership of outcomes/deliverables, and work to ensure their completion in line with stakeholder expectations
- How to effectively diagnose and triage technical issues and provide quick resolutions to customers
- How to lead development of applications/software
- How to become a leader by example in teams, and to set the standards for how work is completed
