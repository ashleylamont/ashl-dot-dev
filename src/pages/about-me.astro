  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    Hi there (again)! I'm Ashley, a twenty-something year old nerd with ADHD
    from the land down under. I'm a software engineer by trade, but I like to
    work with all kinds of interesting projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my spare time, you'll catch me dabbling with crafty things and cosplay,
    writing code for projects I'll never finish, hanging out with my friends,
    doing heaps and heaps of pole dancing (you should try it!), or just playing
    all kinds of different games.{" "}
    {
      steamRecentGames.length > 0 ? (
        <>
          I've been playing a bit of{" "}
          {steamRecentGames.map((game, index) => {
            return (
              /* prettier-ignore */ <>
                <a href={`https://store.steampowered.com/app/${game.appid}`}>{game.name}</a>{/*
                */}{index === steamRecentGames.length - 1 ? (
                  ""
                ) : (
                  <>, {index === steamRecentGames.length - 2 ? "and " : ""}</>
                )}

          })}

        </>
      ) : (
        <>I haven't had too much time to play games lately, but</>
      )
    }
    my all-time most-played are{" "}
    {
      steamMostPlayedGames?.map((game, index) => {

            )}
          </>
        );
      })
    }, and there's a special place in my heart for the <a
      href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1265920/">Life is Strange</a
    > series, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1151640/"
      >Horizon</a
    > series, and <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us">Minecraft</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also listen to a lot of music. Recently I've been listening to{" "}
    {
      spotifyShortTermSongs.map((song, index) => {
        return (
          /* prettier-ignore */ <>

            )}
          </>
        );
      })
    }, but over the last several months, I've listened a bunch to{" "}

            ) : (
              <>{/*

              </>
            )}
          </>
        );
      })
    }.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've also studied computing at the <a href="https://anu.edu.au"
      >Australian National University</a
    >, and spent a lot of time hanging out with the awesome folks over at the <a
      href="https://cssa.club">ANU CSSA</a
    >.
  </p>
  <div>
    I'm also just a massive nerd in general, I'm a big fan of a ton of different
    things, everything from How to Train Your Dragon to She-Ra<span
      class="accent">*</span
    >, and if you let me, I'll probably spend hours geeking out to you about
    them.

    <small style="width: 100%">
      <span class="accent">*</span> Yes, I'm queer, how did you guess?
    </small>
  </div>
  <p>
    In a more general sense, I have a passion for solving interesting problems
    and creating cool things. I love to learn new things and share my knowledge
    with others, and I'm always looking for new opportunities to grow and
    develop my skills, and for new people to meet and learn from. If you're
    interested in working with me, or just want to chat, feel free to reach out
    to me on any of my socials!
